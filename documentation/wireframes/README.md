# UI / UX Planning and Documentation
This is the place to find User Interface and User Experience information for the Roots Wallet mobile apps.

## Mockups
The current mockups are intended to give an idea of where we could be headed.  Much functionality is not yet reflected in the images, including things like buttons to generate / read QR codes, share a verifiable credential, etc.
